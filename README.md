- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Iga54
- ðŸ‘€ I am an open-minded person who embraces change, eagerly learns new programs, and continuously strives to implement AI solutions in everyday life. I am currently seeking a position as a software tester. JavaScript, TypeScript, Postman, and SQL are familiar to me. I can create automated GUI tests using Playwright, API tests in JavaScript and API tests in Postman, and my results can be tracked in my GitHub repositories.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning new functionalities in Playwright.
- âš¡ Facts about me: In my free time, I read about global trends (economy, AI, sociology, psychology, real estate etc.), paint with watercolors, go for long walks, exercise at home, admire art and architecture and take care of my cat.
